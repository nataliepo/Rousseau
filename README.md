# Braided


# Installation

Move the braided/ directory onto your local webserver.

View the braided index in your browser (http://localhost/braided).  You should see an image of a giraffe, since this is the default post XID.  If you want to see another entry, throw it in the url:
    http://localhost/braided/index.php?xid=6a00e5539faa3b88330120a7b004e2970b
for example.  You can discover your post's XID by first logging into TypePad and viewing the post in the editor.  The URL in that context will have two values beginning with '6p': the first is the blog, and the second is the post.
