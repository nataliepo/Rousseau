# Rousseau
An implementation of Rousseau usually exists in three parts:
    SOURCE: A TypePad blog with an APIendpoint exposing recent posts.
    FB-SERVER-APP (*ROUSSEAU*): A Facebook Application that presents those recent posts and allow users to comment on them (in FB).
    CLIENT (*CLAIRE*): Any webpage that wants to access the comments posted on FB about that TypePad blog post.  Note that this set of comments is DIFFERENT than the comments on a TypePad blog post alone. 

# Installation
